# QuestHabit

**Small quests. Epic growth.**

QuestHabit turns everyday habits into small, repeatable quests. Complete a quest, earn XP, build a streak, and make your progress visible without creating an account or sending personal habit data to a server.

It is designed for people who want more structure and motivation from habit tracking without the overhead of a cloud account. QuestHabit is a frontend-only, local-first React application: Vercel hosts the interface, while your profile and progress remain in your browser.

`recharts` and `motion` are declared dependencies for the project's planned analytics and interaction improvements; the current screens use CSS-based presentation and do not yet depend on them at runtime.

## Getting started

Prerequisites: a current Node.js LTS release and npm.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kumudasrip/QuestHabit
cd QuestHabit
npm install
npm run dev
```

Available commands:

```bash
npm run dev       # Start the Vite development server
npm run typecheck # Run the TypeScript project check
npm run lint      # Run ESLint
npm test          # Run Vitest once (unit and accessibility checks)
npm run test:a11y # Run browser-level accessibility checks
npm run build     # Type-check and create dist/
npm run format    # Format files with Prettier
```

## Privacy and local storage

QuestHabit stores profile details, preferences, quests, completion records, and achievement IDs in one browser storage document under the key `questhabit.state`.

- State is loaded when the React app starts.
- Meaningful state changes are serialized immediately through the storage boundary.
- Refreshing or reopening the deployed site in the same browser profile reads the same local data.
- Another browser, device, private window, or cleared site data has a separate or empty state.
- Storage policies, private browsing, quota limits, or disabled storage can prevent persistence.
- Settings can export a JSON backup and import it after basic shape validation and explicit confirmation.
- Corrupt stored JSON starts a fresh local profile and shows a recovery message.

This is local browser storage, not synchronization. Vercel serves static frontend assets and does not become a database for user progress.

## Contributing

Start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md). Please also read the community expectations in [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Useful contribution areas include templates, achievement definitions, cosmetic packs, themes, accessibility, responsive design, analytics, tests, documentation, and performance. All contributions must preserve the frontend-only, local-first model.

## Roadmap

Completed work and proposed milestones are tracked in [docs/ROADMAP.md](./docs/ROADMAP.md). Discuss substantial proposals through GitHub Issues before starting implementation so contributors do not duplicate work.
